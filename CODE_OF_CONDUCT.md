This file contains the code of conduct for contribution in the IntegerSort package. Well, editing or suggestions are based on:
* Man folder:
Each function it's Owen Rd file containing obligatory 'do not run' examples.
* source folder:
Each set of C functions are defined into '.h' header. The R interface contains exporter are defined only in '.cpp' file.
Licences are required for each contributor.
Preferably, C functions use iterators: int * first and it *last
* Rest:
all files are accepted to be modified with no restrictions.
